# Calculator
The calculator project for TOP

This project was so much fun and a huge learning experience for me. There was one point where I felt tired of it and even though I hadn't gotten everything to work
the way I wanted it to I figured I would be able to if needed to and should just skip to the next part of the Odin Project. I ended up changing my mind and pushing 
through, reworking my javascript big time. I'm really glad I did and am so proud of what it turned out to be. The rework allowed me to learn and add new features
to the project.
